# Yingdong He UAL CCI 23/24
 
This project is an exploration of applying the clustering method to the Content-based Filtering recommendation system, based on the concepts and methods introduced in the course 23/24 Personalisation and Machine Learning at UAL CCI led by Louis McCallum, Marysia Ta≈Ñska and Marissa Beaty. Some codes are inspired by the 'Week 3: Content-Based Filtering' course notebook. The code file is programmed to be run under the Python 3.9.18 environment.
