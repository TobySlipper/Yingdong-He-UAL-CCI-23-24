# Yingdong He UAL CCI 23/24
 
This project is an exploration of applying the clustering method to the Content-based Filtering recommendation system, based on the concepts and methods introduced in the course 23/24 Personalisation and Machine Learning at UAL CCI led by Louis McCallum, Marysia Ta≈Ñska and Marissa Beaty. Some codes are inspired by the 'Week 3: Content-Based Filtering' course notebook. The dataset used in this project is contributed by Kaggle user NIK DAVIS, which can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikdavis/steam-store-games. The Python notebook files in this project are programmed to be run under the Python 3.9.18 environment.
